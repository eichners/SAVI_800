Class 7 notes

plugins

use rawgit to copy url of flie and create a cdn for plugin files

look for folder dist
stands for distribution and should have javascript and css files



add code 
for mapzen, just the one line, plus api 
after the map is added

Masking plugin:
look at Leaflet snogylop for an easier way to mask things out
it is a simple inversion of point or polygon styles 

CAN I USE /// 
web site to find out what browsers support


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>EVENTS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

L.Map events 
map specific
add by saying:



var map = L.map ();
map.on(dblclick, function (e) {
	//do something on doublel click
	console.log(e.latlng);
	});


$('.my-buttion').on('click',function (){
	//
});


These events record lat long of clicks or events
one of the properties produced by the MouseEvent will be latlng, or xy coordinates,

look at Properties of L.map events 


L.geoJson(data, { 
onEachFeature: function (feature, layer)
})

.on takes two parameters, first is a string Or the feature, the next one is a ....layer here, not sure 

layer.on('click, function (e, {
	
}

look at event methods on leaflet for reference
